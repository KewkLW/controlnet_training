# Initial Setup

## 1. Install Dependencies
Clone the `diffusers` repository and install it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
cd diffusers
pip install -e .
```

## 2. Install Example Requirements
Move to the example folder and install additional requirements:
```bash
cd example_folder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Dataset and Environment

## 3. Dataset
Make sure you've got the dataset you want to train on.

## 4. Environment Configuration
Initialize an Accelerate environment:
```bash
accelerate config
```

# Training Configuration

## 5. Download Test Images
Download two test conditioning images:
```bash
wget <URL_for_image_1>
wget <URL_for_image_2>
```

## 6. Set Environment Variables
Define the model directory and output directory:
```bash
export MODEL_DIR="your_model_directory"
export OUTPUT_DIR="your_output_directory"
```

## 7. Train Model
Kick off the training using the `train_controlnet.py` script:
```bash
accelerate launch train_controlnet.py --pretrained_model_name_or_path=$MODEL_DIR --output_dir=$OUTPUT_DIR <other_flags>
```

# Optional Optimizations

## 8. Multi-GPU Training
If you have multiple GPUs, use the `--multi_gpu` flag.

## 9. Gradient Accumulation
Reduce VRAM requirements by using smaller batch sizes and gradient accumulation.

## 10. Other Optimizations
Use flags for gradient checkpointing, 8-bit Adam optimizer, etc., as needed.

# Inference

## 11. Run Inference
Once trained, you can use the new model for inference. Use the Python API to load the model and make predictions.

# Additional Settings

- **Training with Flax/JAX:** For TPUs and GPUs, follow similar steps but use `train_controlnet_flax.py`.
- **Google Cloud TPU:** For TPU training, set up a TPU VM and run the Flax/JAX script.
- **Checkpointing:** Use the `--checkpointing_steps=500` flag for intermediate saves.
